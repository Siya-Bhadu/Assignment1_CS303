# Assignment 1 - CS303 (Data Structures)
## Name: Siya Bhadu

## Description
This C++ program reads integers from an input file (A1input.txt) into a one-dimensional array and performs the following operations:

1. Find an integer in the array – returns the index if found.
2. Modify a value at a specified index – shows old and new values.
3. Add a new integer to the end of the array.
4. Remove an integer at a specified index.

The program also demonstrates exception handling for invalid user inputs and array limits.

## Files
- Assignment1_CS303.cpp - Main program with all function implementations.
- Assignment1_CS303.h - Header file containing file declarations.
- A1input.txt - Input file with integers for the array.

## How to Run

1. Open the project in your C++ IDE (Visual Studio)

2. Make sure Assignment1_CS303.h and A1input.txt are in the same project directory as Assignment1_CS303.cpp.

3. Build and run the program.

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to:
- Enter a number to find.
- Enter an index to modify and the new value.
- Enter a new integer to add.
- Enter an index to remove.

5. The program will print updated arrays and handle errors via exceptions if invalid input is provided.


## Sample Outputs

1. Find an integer in the array – returns the index if found.
